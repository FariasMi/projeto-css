# Reponsive Page project 
This is a simple repository with html, css and a bit of javascript focusing on responsive page.
On it, I just added some animation and media query to understand better how to make the page more responsive without any framework. This idea of project follow 
the "Jornada Hiring Coders #3" program, promoted by [Gama Academy](https://www.gama.academy/) and [VTEX](https://vtex.com/us-en/)
